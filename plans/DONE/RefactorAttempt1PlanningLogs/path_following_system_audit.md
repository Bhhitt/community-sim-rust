# Path Following System Audit (2025-04-25)

## System: path_following_system
**File:** src/agent/systems.rs

### Query (as of audit):
```rust
.with_query::<(
    Entity,
    &mut crate::ecs_components::Position,
    &crate::agent::AgentType,
    &mut crate::agent::Hunger,
    &mut crate::agent::Energy,
    Option<&mut Target>,
    Option<&mut Path>,
    &mut crate::agent::AgentState,
    &mut crate::agent::components::IdlePause,
)>()
```
- **Tuple Size:** 9 (exceeds Legion's recommended 8-tuple limit)

### Responsibilities (as observed):
- Handles agent path following logic.
- Updates agent position along a path.
- Manages agent state and transitions (possibly sets Arrived, Idle, etc.).
- Updates hunger and energy.
- May handle pausing or other side effects.
- Potentially performs logging or event emission.

### Audit Notes
- This system appears to mix multiple concerns: path following, movement, state transitions, hunger/energy, pausing, and possibly logging.
- The query tuple size is too large for Legion best practices and may cause runtime issues.
- State transitions and logging should be handled by dedicated systems if not already.
- Recommend splitting this system into smaller, single-responsibility systems.

## 2025-04-25: System Fully Split and Removed
- All responsibilities formerly in path_following_system have now been split into dedicated systems:
  - Pausing: agent_pausing_system (src/ecs/systems/agent.rs)
  - Hunger/Energy: agent_hunger_energy_system (src/ecs/systems/agent.rs)
  - Movement: agent_movement_system (src/ecs/systems/agent.rs)
  - State transitions: agent_state_transition_system (src/ecs/systems/agent.rs)
  - Logging: agent_arrival_logging_system, agent_move_logging_system (src/ecs/systems/agent_logging.rs)
- The path_following_system function has been completely removed from src/agent/systems.rs.
- This completes the refactor and audit plan as outlined in plans/path_following_system_refactor_plan.md.

---

## Next Steps
- Review each new system to ensure they are functioning as expected.
