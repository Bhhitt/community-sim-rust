# Audit: agent_event_log_to_gui_system()

## Location
- File: `src/agent/event_log_bridge.rs`
- Function: `agent_event_log_to_gui_system()`

## System Code (summary)
```rust
/// System to bridge AgentEventLog to EventLog for GUI display
pub fn agent_event_log_to_gui_system() -> impl legion::systems::Runnable {
    SystemBuilder::new("AgentEventLogToGui")
        .write_resource::<Arc<Mutex<EventLog>>()
        .write_resource::<AgentEventLog>()
        .build(|_cmd, _world, (event_log, agent_event_log), _| {
            for event in &agent_event_log.0 {
                event_log.lock().unwrap().push(event.to_log_string());
            }
            agent_event_log.clear();
        })
}
```

## Audit Checklist
- **Single Responsibility:**
  - ✅ Solely bridges agent event log to the main event log for GUI. No unrelated logic.
- **Query Size & Tuple Limit:**
  - ✅ No queries; only resource access. No risk of tuple limit issues.
- **Borrow Patterns:**
  - ✅ Writes to two resources, but both are non-overlapping and safe.
- **Side Effects:**
  - ✅ Moves events from AgentEventLog to EventLog and clears AgentEventLog.
- **Domain Appropriateness:**
  - ✅ Appropriately placed as a bridge between agent logic and GUI event logging.
- **Testability & Extensibility:**
  - ✅ Logic is clear and easy to test or extend if event log formats change.
- **Code Quality:**
  - ✅ Clear, idiomatic ECS code. No extraneous logic.
- **Schedule/Order Dependencies:**
  - ⚠️ Should run after all agent event-producing systems. Document dependency in schedule builder.

## Comments
- This system is focused and minimal.
- Only improvement: document (in schedule builder) that it must run after all agent event-producing systems.

## Audit Status
- ✅ Audited (2025-04-26)
- ⬜ Refactored (pending modular schedule builder)
